Open Source Beehives - Top Bar 2.0
=========

# Project Overview

The Open Source Beehives project is a collaborative response to the threat faced by bee populations in industrialised nations around the world. The project proposes to design hives that can support bee colonies in a sustainable way and to monitor and track the health and behaviour of a colony as it develops. Each hive contains an open source sensory kit, The Smart Citizen Kit (SCK), which can transmit to an open data platform: Smartcitizen.me

These sensor enhanced hive designs are open and freely available online, the data collected from each hive is published together with geolocations allowing for a further comparison and analysis of the hives.

# Top Bar 2.0 Introduction

The Open Source Top Bar 2.0 is designed to be produced using a CNC router. It can be made from a single sheet of plywood. This is a pre-beta version, because it does not include frames for the honeycombs, and we are convinced that the locking mechanism needs to be modified to a wedged mortise and tenon joint design.

By October 5th, 2013, we will see a beta release version that will enter user testing.

## About the Top Bar Design

*A top-bar hive is a single-storey frameless bee hive in which the comb hangs from removeable bars. Hives that have frames or that use honey chambers in summer but which use similar management principles as regular top-bar hives are sometimes also referred to as top-bar hives. Top-bar hives are rectangular in shape and are typically more than twice as wide as multi-storey framed hives commonly found in English speaking countries. Top-bar hives are usually not portable, and allow beekeeping methods that interfere very little with the colony.*
