Open Source Beehives - Top Bar 2.0
=========

# Project Overview

The Open Source Beehives project is a collaborative response to the threat faced by bee populations in industrialised nations around the world. The project proposes to design hives that can support bee colonies in a sustainable way and to monitor and track the health and behaviour of a colony as it develops. Each hive contains an open source sensory kit, The Smart Citizen Kit (SCK), which can transmit to an open data platform: Smartcitizen.me

These sensor enhanced hive designs are open and freely available online, the data collected from each hive is published together with geolocations allowing for a further comparison and analysis of the hives.

# Top Bar 2.0 Introduction

The Open Source Top Bar 2.0 is designed to be produced using a CNC router. It can be made from a single sheet of plywood. This is a pre-beta version, because it does not include frames for the honeycombs, and we are convinced that the locking mechanism needs to be modified to a wedged mortise and tenon joint design.
